This is the first homeword in Mobile App Development

To use this app all you have to do is the click the box that says "Enter your name here" and enter your name.

Once that is done click the button with the text hello.

After that there should be some text that all of a sudden pops up under the button which had the text you left in the textbox on top.

The same applies for the GoodBye button.

And voila thats the end of the first Homework Assignment.
